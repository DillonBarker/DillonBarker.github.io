#### Blog
I am using the website to host a blog which I have began and will continue to write throughout the Makers process.

#### Projects
In my spare time during the lockdown I took to doing some independent projects with data, an example of this is my analysis of the COVID data in the UK, using a dashboarding software called Qlikview, I try to look at any trends the data may suggest and identify where gaps may be.

#### About
Talks about me and what I am doing.

### Jekyll Minimal Mistakes

To help make this website I used a popular template called minimal mistakes, this gave me an outline of what the page could look like and I had to customise it.
