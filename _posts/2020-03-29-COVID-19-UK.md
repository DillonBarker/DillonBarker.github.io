# A brief look at the UK only data, for Corona Virus 19

## Introduction
I built an interactive dashboard on QlikView after loading and cleaning the data in python, the code with data sources for this can be found [here](https://github.com/dilfyg/COVID-19-GitHub/blob/master/uk-data-cleaning.py).

## The Dashboard

This is an image of the dashboard that I made using QlikView, the data is obtained from the link above and loaded into python where I clean and add some variables whilst merging it together. Then it is loaded into QlikView and displayed. This is repeated each day so that when the python script is run the data will be overwritten and new data loaded into QlikView upon opening.
