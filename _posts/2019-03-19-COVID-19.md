# COVID-19 data analysis

## Introduction
Towards the end of December 2019, Chinese public health authorities reported some cases of an acute respiratory disease in the Hubei province in Wuhan. They soon identified a novel coronavirus to be the main cause of these cases. The disease is now, worldwide, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named as a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Which is a new strain of coronavirus not identified in humans before, making it very dangerous. Current research suggests this originated from Bats, in a food market, in Wuhan City.

## Data
I took the data from two sources in order to build a comprehensive dataset.
The sources were [here](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide) and [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases).
This enabled me to track the location of the cases and also the number of cases that were concluded as recovering patients.
