# COVID-19 data analysis

## Introduction
Towards the end of December 2019, Chinese public health authorities reported some cases of an acute respiratory disease in the Hubei province in Wuhan. They soon identified a novel coronavirus to be the main cause of these cases. The disease is now, worldwide, referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Which is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans, making it very dangerous. Current research suggests this originated from Bats, in a food market in Wuhan City.
