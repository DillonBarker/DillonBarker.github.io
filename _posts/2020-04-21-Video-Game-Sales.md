# Video Game Sales Project
Here I wanted to showcase the use of MS SQL server alongside Tableau, as they work very well together and you can easily visualise datasets.

# Introduction
I used MS SQL server in this project, alongside Tableau. Importing the csv data file into the server enabled me to directly link this to Tableau.

I chose the dataset of video games as I thought I could get good insight and ask some good questions of the data in order to obtain some conclusions as an exercise for myself.

In this I used what I normally use to help me organise and plan out projects, Trello. Which I will put as a link so that you can see how I worked through the data and my thought process behind what I did.

# Set up
The first problem I encountered was that some of the names were continuing on into the next column due to them having a comma inside the name. This was easy to fix as I just made sure that there was a text qualifier present and surrounded the names of the titles in speech marks. Now the data was in the correct format and ready for analysis.
