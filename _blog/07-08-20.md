**JAVASCRIPT WEEK HAS JUST GONE BY!**

This week was designated to learning the skill of learning a new coding language. It was far easier than I first thought after spending the last few months with Ruby. This is probably because of the packages we were using for testing had very similar syntax (other than the JS conventions).

But, as a whole the whole process hasn't been as hard as first thought, the best way I found to getting the most out of the week is to just dive in, as you learn far more from just typing out the syntax for methods and classes, than reading. Then save the reading time for learning about how it works and the similarities and differences, in particular with javascript I found learning about ```this``` is a good idea, as its a powerful command that does many of the important roles that are so key in Ruby. (such as having attribute like functionality when used like this ```this.example = 0```, which is basically the same as ```@example = 0```)

In terms of resources for this week [here](https://www.w3schools.com/), was probably my most used and I found had so many useful examples and good explanations if i was ever stuck during coding.

Cheers!
