Today I went about setting up the Cloud9 Environment for the precourse. This is the reccomended choice if you do not have a apple device, It was easy to do following [this]("https://blog.makersacademy.com/how-to-get-a-professional-coding-environment-anywhere-with-aws-cloud9-f13d0424271") blog post written by Henry Cooksley.

It is running a Amazon Linux PC for me in the cloud which I can access from any PC with the correct sign in information.
Here is my environment I named makers, I will now look into any extra prep I can do to this environment.
