So, the last two or so weeks have been great and I have felt myself improve greatly, just by dedicating a bit of time each day to the tasks we were given. This was 2 weeks to cover 10 quizzes which all were based off different topics. There was revision like work to go through with and then you would complete the quiz after, using a neat rspec and github to check answers and upload them once done to get the new quiz.

There were some hurdles to overcome due to the code having to pass these tests through rspec and alot of messing around with code. But, this ensured the code was correct and read properly. (I didn't realise I was doing so many unnecessary indentations etc. which would make my work hard to read for someone else. So its great practice for that.)

My favorite part was making a very very simple river game with an array. Shown in the picture below.

It was just a nice little game which was very simple but I liked the way I solved it using an equation for the location movement, thought it was a cool touch, but I look forward to getting into this and I am keen to write some sort of adventure text based game along the side. (But using classes and all that good stuff i've learnt a bit about)

I now look forward to working more on ruby in the final week of the precourse, so far so good and its been excellent!

**Completed week 2 and 3, this covered mastering the Ruby language going back over the main concepts in far more detail than Code Academy!!!!**

Happy Thursday,

Dill
