excerpt: "I am going to be blogging here as I go through the Makers process."

My precourse starts on the 8th of June, so right now I am beginning to set up my developer environment for the course.
From the start day, I will try to post a blog each day of the work, and name it Day 1, Day 2 etc..

The idea of this is to help me review what I have learnt that day, and maybe be a showcase to potential makers in the future... who knows.

Thanks,

Dill
