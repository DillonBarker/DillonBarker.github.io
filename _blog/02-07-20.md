The final exercise of the precourse at Makers was to create a student directory which has an interface that you can interact with and use from the command line. This was a challenge and some parts were very tough with alot of understanding having to be greatly built on. This was no trouble as the resources provided (knowledge pills are what they are called) are excellent and if I did not understand something I would go there and it would help greatly.

My student directory is pretty much complete now, I am just trying to add some more functionalities to it based on the extended exercises. If you want to have a look at it, the repository is on my [github](https://github.com/DillonBarker/student-directory).

Now I look to tomorrow where the Macbook will be arriving, this is what they send out to you for the remote course so that everyone can be on the same system, to avoid technical issues. Over the weekend I will be setting that up with everything that I had on my Linux system i've been using. Linux has been great and this subsystem that Windows provides has been cool to try out, I have even now installed Ubuntu fully on my laptop due to enjoying it so much!

**Now begins the properly hard work, the course from Monday is going into full time mode!**
Thanks,

Dill
