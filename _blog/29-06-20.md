As the precourse for Makers comes to an end in this final week, one of the tasks is to pair program over the rather simple fizzbuzz task. The solution to the actual problem is easy as its something we have already done prior to this. However, this also involves using git and working with Rspec.

Rspec is a great gem which you can use to run tests on your code, these tests we wrote on our own to see how it works to success. It also gets you to think about how the **require** function works.
 
 Here is the github respository page, where my partner made and linked me as a collaborator, so now I can also edit its contents, pretty cool!

**Working on being able to effectively pair program over zoom!**

Thanks,
