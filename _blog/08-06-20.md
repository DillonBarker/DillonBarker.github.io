To start, I looked through the resources which covered various points, but mainly getting to know the system that you choose to use. I chose to use the Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL). This enables me to use an Ubuntu shell from within my windows. Which is perfect for me as I did not have a Mac. There are lots of links online how to do this, just type "WSL2 setup".

Originally, I was going to use the Cloud9 environment on AWS which was recommended, but after talking to the coaches they said that Ubuntu would work well too. After looking into it I thought it would be good practice and I already have a little experience with linux. (and i'm starting to read **Linux Pocket Guide by Daniel J. Barrett**) Then followed the steps reccomended on the [preparetocode.io](http://www.preparetocode.io/) which they provided. This steps you through the set up and gets you to install and configure your development environment.

The first week is going to consist of 3 main points. Building the development environment, which is done. Using the command line and then using version control.

**Using Linux shell commands, like mkdir and mv which I haven't used before**
