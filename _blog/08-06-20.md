I started by going through the instructions, which involved a bit of reading and just getting to know the system you will be using. I chose to try and use the Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL). This enables me to use an Ubuntu with its shell from within my windows. Which is perfect for me. There are lots of links online how to do this just type WSL2.

Originally I was going to use the Cloud9 environment on AWS which was recommended, but after talking to the coaches they said that Ubuntu would work well only if I had an understanding already of Linux (I do have a brief one) - therefore I went with WSL. Then followed the steps reccomended on the [preparetocode.io](http://www.preparetocode.io/) they provided.

The first week is going to consist of 3 main points. Building the development environment, which is done. Using the command line and then using version control.

**Using Linux shell commands, like mkdir and mv which I haven't used before**

Thanks,

Dill
