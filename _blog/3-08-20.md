Finally, at long last, this week just gone was.... **FULL STACK WEEK!**. This was the first time I properly felt like something that I built wasn't completely flawed, obviously because we are learning new techniques and such we wouldn't be building anything amazing or jaw dropping but, the weekend challenge where we were asked to build a Twitter clone (Chitter), was a real great achievement for me.

The full stack implies we are using a database alongside our back end code, with html on the front end interacting with each other following the MVC pattern. This was great as diagramming before doing the task really came into its own, I designed the data tables and then the classes. This gave me a jumpstart into the challenge, and although it didn't look pretty the functions were very cool, the password encryption gem (bcrypt), was an excellent touch and was fun to use.

Moving on from this week, we are heading away for databases briefly to quickly learn the basics of JavaScript. Writing this I am a few days into that week, and it is great! Ruby knowledge helps so much, then its just a google away from knowing the correct syntax.

Thanks,

Dillon
