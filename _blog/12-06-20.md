Today I completed the last step of the Murder Mystery Task, which was good fun and found the culprit and it all worked smoothly. This involved using the **grep** command multiple times across a number of files in a directory, and then count whether or not the string I was searching for with **grep** was there or not.

Next step is to move back to Ruby which I covered to get onto the course, via Codewars and Codeacademy. So before I start I will probably try a few more Codewars problems to get back into the swing of things.

##Here is my current, as of 16:30 12/06/20, stats!!
