Hi there,

So, after finishing the bootcamp, and doing a bit of python before and during the course. I wanted to get some practice making a full stack web app in python, like I have with Ruby. 

After some research and reading I came across this [2020 article](https://hackr.io/blog/flask-vs-django) which seemed like the perfect bit of guidance for what I wanted. 

It talks about the two main frameworks for python web development (to my knowledge). And gives a great comparison between the two. To relate it to work that I have done before, Ruby on Rails is similar to Django and the lighter weight flask is like the lighter weight Sinatra for Ruby.

When learning Ruby web development, I used Sinatra first which gave me a good understanding of routing, databases and particularly the SQL queries you have to write to interact with the databases. This is similar to what you have to do in Flask, so I will use this before using Django. Django like Rails automates alot of the typical long winded setup up, aswell as removing the need for querying. So can be used to get a full-stack web app up and going quicker with lots of cool features. 

**Flask is lighweight, Django is heavyweight**
