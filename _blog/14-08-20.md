This week was a chance to work in a group setting for the first time whilst at Makers. This led to new challenges in organisation, delegation and all sorts. Initially it was a hard process in the first day, as we were not used to all working from the same directory and were running into various compatibility issues within our code. But once reading a few articles and using the pull request on GitHub we got into a good rhythm and began getting through the goals to design a AirBnB clone.

The task involved creating a full-stack web app, using Ruby. Which going back to after a week of JS was actually quite challenging but you pick it back up almost instantly after initialising a repository with all the gems you need.

The initial challenges were overcome by a great teamwork dynamic which stemmed from our awesome planning stage at the very start of the challenge. I recommend to anyone working at Makers in the future, to greatly prioritise people and making sure everyone is going to be happy on the project, as that led to our success!

Thanks,

Dillon
