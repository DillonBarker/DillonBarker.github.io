So, this is the end of the precourse. My Makers provided MacBook has just arrived and I am going through a similar process to almost a month ago. Where I am setting it up as a developer environment. Using [preparetocode.io](https://www.preparetocode.io/).

To set up the macbook and add some customisation I found that iTerm was a good way to get a good looking and highly functional terminal. It works great with git and shows me how many changes I have staged and unstaged in a respository as I am editing from the command line. I found [this](https://medium.com/macoclock/how-to-customize-your-own-osx-linux-terminal-af24c15f7704) article particularly helpful.

I am very excited for the first day Monday and can't wait to get properly started full time on this journey. The precourse has been a great and well put together bit of learning and everyone at times has pulled together to help someone out!

So this is the last blog post on the precourse and further on will be the real deal. My aim will be to do a blog post each week, throughout the week I want to try and keep notes on what people might want to know about day to day life as a Makers student.

Thanks,
Dillon
