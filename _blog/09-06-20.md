The focus today was week 1 command line, it covers a variety of important commands and how and when to use them.

Also I learnt about environments and profile files. This enables you to work with both local environments and then to export these to the bash_profile so that they are availible in all shells.

This picture shows the use of pipes, find, wildcards and grep (which searches within files)

**Using pipes to achieve the output desired, you can get a output and input this into another command or program and get that result instead of both**

Thanks,
