In the last two days I brushed up on my skills with [GitHub](https://github.com/dilfyg?tab=repositories) using the rest of the work from Makers, which I have used before so didn't find anything too difficult here. Other than getting a better understanding of a few common commands such as **git checkout**.

The last part of this weeks work is to solve a murder mystery. This aims to incorporate everything surrounding the command line that has been learnt through the Makers Teachable platform. It is good fun and I am currently on the last stage and looking to finish it tomorrow. The steps are clear and its good to work with github repositories as that's been noted as a common skill within this course.

Also to note, I attended a Makers (but was open to public) lecture today given by Zack Akil. This covered the basics of machine learning, which is something I find very interesting and gave a good insight to the key skills and also some cool areas that you could look into. Such as, using blender for 3D modelling of regression models.

**Compiling all the knowledge from the precourse, from piping to git**

Have a good day,

Dill
